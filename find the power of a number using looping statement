 Find power of a number
Send Feedback
Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


Input format :

Two integers x and n (separated by space)

Output Format :

x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 8 
0 <= n <= 9

Sample Input 1 :

 3 4

Sample Output 1 :

81




solution:


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// Write your code here
    int x,n;
    int power=1;
    cin>>x>>n;
    int i=1;
    if(x==0&&n==0)
    {
        
        power=1;
      
        
    }
  else if(x==0&&n!=0)
  {
      power=0;
  }
  else{
    while(i<=n)
    {
        power=power*x;
        i++;
    }
}
    cout<<power;
    
    
	
}
